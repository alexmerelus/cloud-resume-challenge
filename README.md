# My [Cloud Resume](https://alexmerelus.me) ☁️

## Introduction
This project is a manifestation of the Cloud Resume Challenge, where I've employed several AWS services and best practices to deploy a static website, integrated with a backend to showcase my resume and cloud skills. With a primary focus on cloud security and compliance templates, this endeavor was both challenging and rewarding.

## Features
- **Static Website**: Hosted on AWS S3, presenting my professional journey.
- **Backend API**: Leveraged AWS Lambda and API Gateway to serve dynamic data.
- **Visitor Counter**: Implemented using DynamoDB to track the number of visitors.
- **CI/CD**: Automatic deployment and testing using GitHub Actions.

## Architecture Diagram
(architecture diagram here coming soon.)

## Technologies Used
- **AWS Services**: S3 for static hosting, Lambda for serverless computing, API Gateway for routing, DynamoDB for storing visitor counts.
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: AWS CloudFormation (You can update this if you decide on another tool).
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions for automated deployments and testing.

## Setup and Deployment
To replicate this project:
1. Ensure AWS environment is set up with necessary permissions.
2. Clone this GitHub repository.
3. Use CloudFormation (or your IaC tool) to deploy the infrastructure.
4. Follow additional setup instructions provided in the deployment scripts.

## Challenges and Learning
Venturing into the cloud ecosystem, especially AWS, was a journey filled with challenges. From understanding the intricacies of S3 bucket policies to setting up a serverless backend with Lambda, every step was a learning experience. Emphasizing security and compliance templates deepened my understanding of the importance of cloud security.

## Modifications and Extensions
- **Cloud Security Focus**: Incorporated best practices and templates to ensure the cloud infrastructure is secure and compliant.

## Acknowledgements
