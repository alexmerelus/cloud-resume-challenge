# My [Cloud Resume](https://www.alexmerelus.me) ☁️

## Introduction
This project is a manifestation of the Cloud Resume Challenge, where I've employed several AWS services and best practices to deploy a static website, integrated with a backend to showcase my resume and cloud skills. With a primary focus on cloud security and compliance templates.

## Features
- **Static Website**: Hosted on AWS S3, presenting my professional journey.
- **Backend API**: Leveraged AWS Lambda and API Gateway to serve dynamic data.
- **Visitor Counter**: Implemented using DynamoDB to track the number of visitors.
- **CI/CD**: Automatic deployment and testing using GitHub Actions.

## Technologies Used
- **AWS Services**: S3 for static hosting, Lambda for serverless computing, API Gateway for routing, DynamoDB for storing visitor counts.
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: AWS CloudFormation (Coming Soon)
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions for automated deployments and testing.


## Challenges and Learning
Venturing into the cloud ecosystem, especially AWS, was a journey filled with challenges. From understanding the intricacies of S3 bucket policies to setting up a serverless backend with Lambda, every step was a learning experience. Emphasizing security and compliance templates deepened my understanding of the importance of cloud security.

## Modifications and Extensions
- **Cloud Security Focus**: Incorporated best practices and templates to ensure the cloud infrastructure is secure and compliant.
